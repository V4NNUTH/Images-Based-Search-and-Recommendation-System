# Image-Based Search and Recommendation System

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of an image-based search and recommendation system. It covers various techniques and models used to achieve accurate and efficient image retrieval and recommendations.
### Problem Statement
When users are searching e-commerce platforms, they typically search
for product names and descriptions. Suppose you are looking for a blue
t-shirt. You can use a basic search phrase to get relevant results. However,
say you like a t-shirt that you saw someone wearing at a party and it is
blue with white stripes and has a black floral print with a red collar. Thatâ€™s
a difficult phrase to search for, and the results will be uninspired. This is
where image-based search and recommendation systems come in.

## Sections

1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of image-based search and recommendation systems and their applications.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Steps to preprocess the dataset, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation of images.

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Methods for extracting features from images using pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, etc.

4. **Similarity Calculation**
   - Techniques to calculate similarity between images using distance metrics such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, etc.
